When upgrading any of these dependencies, keep the following in mind:


## Markdeep

* Get the new `relativize.css` from [here](https://github.com/doersino/markdeep-relative-sizes).
* Add support (and maybe a slide in the demo presentation) for any newly added constructs.
* Update the include path at the bottom of the demo presentation to match the new version.


## MathJax

* [Strip it down](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-docs/wiki/Guide:-reducing-size-of-a-mathjax-installation/1814429ed1e97bfb7675c0fd400804baa9287249) to match the currently included version in terms of feature set and size.
* Update the include path at the bottom of the demo presentation to match the new version.


## Webfonts

* Update their import paths in the themes that use them.
